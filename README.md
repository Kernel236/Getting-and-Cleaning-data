# ðŸ“Š Human Activity Recognition â€“ Tidy Dataset Project

This project is based on the [UCI Human Activity Recognition Using
Smartphones
Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).
The goal is to **clean and transform raw sensor data** into a tidy
dataset, summarizing the mean of each measurement variable for each
activity and each subject.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

-   Merge training and test datasets.
-   Extract only measurements on the **mean and standard deviation**.
-   Assign descriptive activity names.
-   Label dataset with descriptive variable names.
-   Create a second, independent tidy dataset with the **average of each
    variable for each activity and each subject**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

This project uses the following R packages:

``` r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "here"))
```

ðŸš€ Steps Performed 1. Data Import The raw data is read from the UCI HAR
Dataset folder using read.table() and paths are handled using the here
package to maintain portability.

``` r
x_train, y_train, subject_train   # Training data
x_test, y_test, subject_test      # Test data
features                          # Feature (variable) names
activity_labels                   # Activity code-to-label mapping
```

2.  Merge Datasets Training and test sets are merged using rbind() to
    create unified data:

``` r
x_data <- rbind(x_train, x_test)
y_data <- rbind(y_train, y_test)
subject_data <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test)
```

3.  Label and Filter Measurements Variable names are applied using
    features.txt.

Only columns related to mean() and std() are extracted using a regex and
grep().

``` r
mean_and_std <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", features[, 2])
x_data_filtered <- x_data[, mean_and_std]
```

4.  Assign Descriptive Activity Names Activity IDs are replaced with
    descriptive labels using case_when()

``` r
y_data$V1 <- dplyr::case_when(
  y_data$V1 == 1 ~ "WALKING",
  y_data$V1 == 2 ~ "WALKING_UPSTAIRS",
  y_data$V1 == 3 ~ "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS",
  y_data$V1 == 4 ~ "SITTING",
  y_data$V1 == 5 ~ "STANDING",
  y_data$V1 == 6 ~ "LAYING"
)
```

5.  Create Tidy Dataset A clean, tidy dataset is created by binding
    subject, activity, and filtered measurement data:

``` r
tidy_data_filtered <- cbind(subject_data, y_data, x_data_filtered)
names(tidy_data_filtered)[2] <- "Activity"
names(tidy_data_filtered)[1] <- "Subject"
```

6.  Export Tidy Data The final tidy dataset is saved as a .txt file

``` r
write.table(tidy_data_filtered, file = "tidy_data_filtered.txt", row.names = FALSE)
```

ðŸ’¾ Output The file tidy_data_filtered.txt contains:

One row for each subject/activity combination.

Columns with the mean and standard deviation of each selected feature.

This dataset is suitable for further statistical analysis, machine
learning, or building interactive dashboards (e.g., with Shiny).

ðŸ’¡ Possible Extensions Create a second tidy dataset grouped by subject
and activity using group_by() and summarise_all(mean).

Build a Shiny dashboard for visual exploration.

Apply clustering algorithms to identify activity patterns.

Extend the analysis for clinical purposes (e.g., ICU patient motion
monitoring).
